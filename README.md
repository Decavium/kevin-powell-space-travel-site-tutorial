# kevin-powell-space-travel-site-tutorial
This is a tutorial I have followed to build a space travel site hosted on scrimba: https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel/using-our-general-utility-classes-co0ab4674a5afa4bea6e830cc

In addition to following the tutorial, I have decided to build the project using NextJS.
